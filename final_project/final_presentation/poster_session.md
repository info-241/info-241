# Poster Session Guidance 

For the Spring 2024 semester, we are going to conduct our final presentations as a group "poster" session. Here's what this means: 

1. We will divide ourselves into two groups: (a) a "California Blue" group; and, (b) a "Golden Bears" group. Each group will contain about four teams. 
2. For the first 35 minutes of Week 14, the California Blue teams will present their work in the form of a "poster" session while the Golden Bears teams will be the audience for the session. 
3. Then, for the second 35 minutes of Week 14, we will change roles and the Golden Bears will present to the California Blues. 

# Why A Poster Session? 

By placing constraints on your presentation, you will find creativity! The constraints of a poster are real! 

1. You only get the physcial space of the poster; this forces you to prioritize your conversation.  
2. You have to communicate much of your story visually.
3. Design matters for storytelling!

Creating a poster requires that you think about how you can tell your story to a passing audience, in a way that they can engage with you and ask questions, and you can quickly show results to support your response. 

In many ways, although the "mode" of a poster is a weird academic conference construct, it is the ideal form of "read out" of results!
