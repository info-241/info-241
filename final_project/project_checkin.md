# Project Check-In

How are things going? At this point in the project, we would like to take a moment to evaluate the group's progress and approach and ensure that there is a clear plan to bring the project to the end of the semester successfully. 

Your group will be responsible for producing two documents for this check-in. Neither should be overly bespoke. 

1. Your team will produce document that is not longer than a page or two to brief your instructor about your progress. This document should brief your instructor so that the team and instructor can have a productive check-in meeting.
2. Your team will produce a document that is not longer than a slide or two to brief the class about your progress. This document should be useful to have a discussion with the *other* teams in the course in live-session. 

# Possible Topics of Discussion 

Although there are no mandatory, or necessary points that you have to talk about, here are some options that you might talk about in your check-in.

## Treatment Design 

So frequently, this is the crux of any experiment: _What should we actually do?_ How has this design process proceeded? What has led you to believe that the content that your experimental are assigned is going to _cause_ differences in their behavior. Have you spoken with anybody (i.e. in a focus group, or interview) about your treatment and how it makes them feel? Is there published literature that makes you believe this will be true?

## Experiment Design 

Does the team have a clear experiment design? When, relative to treatment-assignment will subjects be measured? Before? After? Many times? Are there any concerns that people will opt-out of the treatment condition that you assign to them? Are there any concerns that people may opt-out of participating in your experiment? Are there any concenrs that people will _forget_ they are a part of your experiment? 

## Measurement Design 

What is the team's strategy for measuring outcomes? 

- Is the team going to rely on "self-reported" survey data? If so, how accurate a measurement will this produce? What _specific_ question wording will the team be using in a survey? Share this with your instructor. 
- Is the team going to rely on "revealed preference" data like on-device clicks, purchases, or other _direct_ measurements of the outcome? If so, how has this been designed, and does it do a good job of capturing the concept that the team is interested in learning about?

# Submitting 

Please submit your written check-in document in Gradescope so that your instructor has the document on hand for when you conduct your check-in meeting. 

## Schedule a meeting with your instructor 

When the team turns in their responses to this document, please also schedule a time to meet with your instructor to talk about the teams progress to-date. Your instructor will discuss scheduling this in live-session. 

## Presenting in Class 

The week that this is due, we will spend the first 20 minutes of our live-session meeting talking about the work that each of the teams have done to this point, raising issues that we are facing, and working on solutions for how to overcome these issues. Each team will have five minutes allocated. Our hope is that this presentation can be useful to help teams recognize where they are using similar techniques, or are facing similar challenges, so that the teams can work together to solve these.
