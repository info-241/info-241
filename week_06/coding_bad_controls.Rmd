What goes wrong with bad controls? Everything! 

# A Very Simple Example 
Let's make some data in just the same way that we typically make data.

First, let's make and `id` variable, an `epsilon` variable that represents everything in the world that we haven't measured, a `D` variable that represents the assignment to treatment, and a `tau` variable that represents each individuals response to treatment if he or she or it is exposed to the treatment. 

```{r} 
d <- data.table(
  id  = 1:1000, 
  epsilon = rnorm(1000), 
  D   = sample(0:1, 1000, replace = TRUE),
  tau = rnorm(n = 1000, mean = 2, sd = 1)
)
``` 

Now, lets make the *slightly* more complicated quantities, `x`, the bad control, and the potential outcomes. We're going to take some care to create the x-variable. As we show in the figure below, the x-variable is **caused** by both the treatment and other things in the system. 

For example, consider the case of the white collar and blue collar jobs. If you're born the heir of a real-estate empire in NY (in this case represented by $\epsilon$), you might be likely, no matter your college attendance or draft status, to end up in a white collar job (in this case represented in $X$). But, it may also be the case in the data that having been assigned to attend college (in this case represented in $D$) increases the probability that you get a white collar job. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("./coding_bad_controls_diagram.pdf")

```

Suppose that we measure four variables, $D, x, Y, \epsilon$ that all have a positive relationship between one another, shown in the figures above.  The one exception, and this is important to make this example easy-ish to understand, is that $x$ actually has *no* relationship on Y.

The way we've built this data, if someone is in treatment ($D=1$), then they're more likely to have a larger value for $X$ and also a larger value for $Y$. Similarly, if someone has a high $\epsilon$ value, then they're more likely to have a higher value for $X$ and also a higher value for $Y$. 

In the figure on the left, where we've included dotted-line relationships between $D$, $X$, and $\epsilon$, we're acknowledging that these relationships exist, but we're not going to condition on them. As a result, there is no covariance between $D$ and $\epsilon$, which we represent with no line. 
In the figure on the right, consider that we've conditioned on the $X$ variable. As a result, there is a solid line relationship between $\epsilon$ and $X$; but so too is there a solid line relationship between $\epsilon$ and $D$ **after we condition on $X$**. 

Perhaps think of it this way -- if we don't condition on $X$ then any value of $\epsilon$ is possible, and so too is any value of $D$. But, after we set the $X$ to a value by conditioning on it, some arrangements are more likely to have been the case than others. 

- If we don't condition on $X$, and if $\epsilon$ is low, it could still be the case that the unit was in treatment or was in control. We don't have any conditional information. 
- But, if we condition so that the units we're considering have a $X=1$, and if $\epsilon$ is low, then *we can know* that the person was more likely to be in the treatment group than the control group. 

Let's make these, carefully. Create the variable $x$, the realization of the variable $X$ to be a binary indicator that takes the values of either 1 or 0. And, suppose that the probability of being a 1 increases if you're in treatment and also if you've got a high value of epsilon. (I'm going to scale these probabilities using a `pnorm` call, just so that the values for the `prob` argument to `rbinom` conforms to be a valid probability statement.  

```{r}
d[ , x := rbinom(n = 1000, size = 1, prob = pnorm(2*D + epsilon))]
``` 

# Questions for Understanding 

1. If we examine the relationship between $x$ and $D$ with a regression, should the relationship be positive, negative, or we don't know? 
2. If we examine the relationship between $x$ and $\epsilon$ with a regression, should the relationship be positive, negative, or we don't know? 
3. **Challenge**: If we examine the regression of `x ~ D + epsilon` what will be the nature of each variables' relationship with x? Will they be the same, different, and will they be positive, negative, or we don't know? 

```{r}
mod_d    <- d[ , lm(x ~ D)]
mod_x    <- d[ , lm(x ~ epsilon)]
mod_both <- d[ , lm(x ~ D + epsilon)]

```

```

## Make Potential Outcomes 

To this point, we haven't actually built any outcomes, we've been principally concerned with building the *upstream* data for our causal system. Let's make those potential outcomes now. 

For everybody, their potential outcomes to control are a combination of some individual idiosyncratic value (represented by the random draw in this code), plus their $x$ value, plus all the other features in the world that we haven't measured, their $\epsilon$.

```{r} 
d[ , y0 := runif(1000, min = 0, max = 10) + epsilon]
``` 

**Question for understanding** 

Do we **need** in a strict sense to define the potential outcomes to treatment on this data? Or, would that information simply be a linear combination of some data that we already have in hand? 

Finally, let's produce a measured outcome value for $Y$. 

```{r}
d[ , Y := as.numeric(NA)]
d[D==0, Y := y0]
d[D==1, Y := y0 + tau]
```

# Finally, Estimate Causal Effects 

In the world that we've occupied to this point, whether we *do* or *do not* condition on a variable, an experiment that we've executed that has successfully randomized the treatment should produce a reliable causal estimate. That is, in this setup, **if we estimate a model, it should provide us with an unbiased estiamte of $\tau$, or 2.**. 

```{r}
unconditional_model <- d[ , lm(Y ~ D)]
```

But, what is going to happen if we use a *cough cough bad...* control variable to "clean up our estimate". After all, if controls only *increase the accuracy of our predictions*, then this will improve our model right? 

```{r}
bad_control_model <- d[ , lm(Y ~ D + x)]
```


What are other ways that we could see this relationship? Well, earlier we talked about "setting x to be equal to 1". Let's try that on this data. Among the people who have an $x$ value that is one, what is the causal relationship between D and Y? 

```{r}
x_equals_one_model  <- d[x==1, lm(Y ~ D)]
x_equals_zero_model <- d[x==0, lm(Y ~ D)]
```



```{r, results='asis'}
stargazer(
  unconditional_model, bad_control_model, x_equals_one_model, x_equals_zero_model, 
  type = 'latex', header = FALSE, table.placement = 'h', 
  digits = 2, 
  add.lines = list(c("Data Subset", "All", "All", "$x==1$")),
