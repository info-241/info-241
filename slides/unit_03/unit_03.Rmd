# Sampling Distribution and Randomization Inference

---

# Standard Errors 

- Standard deviation of the sampling distribution 
- How spread out is the sampling distribution? 
- How large are the typical chance differences? 
- Later, we'll examine statistical power 
  - The spread of the sampling distribution is the standard error 
  - In what kinds of experiments are large and small differences likely to arise by chance? 
  
---

# Sampling Distributions and Randomization Inference

- First, read GG 3.0, 3.1, 3.4.
- Groups may differ by chance, even if the treatment has no effect.
  - How much would the groups differ if the treatment had no effect?
  - How large of an "effect estimate" would we reach by chance?
- Distribution of estimates one would reach if treatment had no effect.
  - How likely is this estimate to have just arisen by
chance?
- Similar to observational studies, but:
  - Intuition easy to see in experiments.
  - Testing a hypothesis about our sample, not a population.
  - Example code to walk through intuition on slides to follow

# Example: An Experiment with no Effect

- Does eating soybeans affect estrogen levels?
- 40 individuals: 20 men, 20 women.
- Simulate the potential outcomes of the control group. 
- Simulate the potential outcomes of the treatment group. 
- A simulated experiment with no effect.

---

```{r make potential outcomes} 
group <- c(rep("Man",20),rep("Woman",20))

po_control <- c(
  seq(from = 1, to = 20), 
  seq(from = 51, to = 70)) 

## Suppose there is no effect. 
## Then, the potential outcomes to control are equal 
## to the potential outcomes to treatment. 
po_treatment <- po_control 
```

---

```{r plot outcomes, echo = FALSE, dev='svglite', fig.height=4, fig.align='center'} 
ggplot() + 
  aes(x=po_control, color = group) +
  geom_density() + 
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of Potential Outcomes", 
    subtitle = "Man identifiers have lower estrogen",
    x = 'Potential Outcomes', 
    y = 'Density', 
    color = 'Identity Group'
  )
```

---

# Random Assignment 

- Define function to randomly assign units to treatment and control.
- Randomly pick 20 for treatment and 20 for control. 
- Concatenate the two vectors.
- Get a different vector when you run it again.

---

# Random Assignment

```{r define randomizaton function}
randomize <- function(units_per_group) { 
  ## an (unnecessary) function to randomize units into 
  ## treatment and control 
  ## ---
  ## args: 
  ##  - units_per_group: how many zero and one should be returned
  
  assignment_vector <- rep(c('Control', 'Treatment'), each = units_per_group)
  sample(assignment_vector)
} 

randomize(units_per_group = 4) 
randomize(units_per_group = 4) 
```

---

# Realized Outcomes 

- Treatment outcome for those randomized to treatment and control outcome for those randomized to control.
- Assign for each person in the vector.
- Same because we had an experiment with no effect.
- R code is often written in a compact manner; could also have been done separately for each group.
- Why are we doing this when there is no treatment effect?
- Because it should also work when there is one. We're looking at what happens when we randomly assign people to control and treatment groups.

---

# Realized Outcomes

```{r assign treatment}
treatment_assigned <- randomize() 

outcomes <- po_treatment * I(treatment_assigned == "Treatment") + 
  po_control * I(treatment_assigned == "Control")

outcomes
```

---

# Function to Estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) 

- Subtract the mean outcome for the control group from the mean outcome of the treatment group.
- How much higher is the average in the treatment group versus the control group?
- We may have randomly selected someone with a higher or lower level of estrogen.
- Even though we know the effect is 0, we see chance differences.

---

# Function to Estimate the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) 

```{r estimate ate }
estimate_ate <- function(y_values, treatment) { 
  
  treatment_group_mean <- mean(outcomes[treatment == 'Treatment'])
  control_group_mean   <- mean(outcomes[treatment == 'Control'])
  
  ate <- treatment_group_mean - control_group_mean
  
  return(
    list(
      "tg_mean" = treatment_group_mean, 
      "cg_mean" = control_group_mean, 
      "ate" = ate)
  )
}

# In fact, there is _no_ effect, but... sampling! 
estimate_ate(y_values = outcomes, treatment = treatment_assigned) 
```

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# The Null Hypothesis

---

# Rhetorical Posture of the Null Hypothesis
- You want to argue against a skeptic that a treatment has an effect.
- Assume the skeptic is right.

> Treatment has no effect.

- What is the chance that we would see this estimate by chance in that scenario?

> This is p-value.

- Weâ€™ll see where it comes from visually.

---

# Average Size of the Difference

- Simulate this a few times to get a sense of how much our treatment effect estimate would vary by chance.
- We created an estimate function with the outcomes and the treatment group.
- Outcome vector will look the same regardless of the treatment vector.

```{r a few experiments}
treatment_assigned_one <- randomize(units_per_group = 20)
estimate_ate(y_values = outcomes, treatment = treatment_assigned_one) 

treatment_assigned_two <- randomize(units_per_group = 20)
estimate_ate(y_values = outcomes, treatment = treatment_assigned_two) 

treatment_assigned_three <- randomize(units_per_group = 20)
estimate_ate(y_values = outcomes, treatment = treatment_assigned_three) 
```

---

# Outcome With Different Assignments

- Similar to re-sampling from a population.
- Re-randomizing from within the original population. Testing the null hypothesis from within the sample we already have.
- Re-shuffle the 40 people between treatment and control. Assuming the treatment effect for everyone is zero. 
- **Sharp null hypothesis**: For every unit, there is no effect.
- Repeat this process to generate a synthetic distribution of effects if the sharp null hypothesis *were true*. 

- Randomly sample the vector of assignments 5,000 times to generate an unbiased sample of all the effects.
- Literally, replicate 5,000 times, and save to a vector.

---

```{r}
## going to move the randomization inside the `estimate_ate` function 
## for compactness 

sharp_null <- replicate(
  n = 5000, 
  expr = estimate_ate(
    y_value = outcomes, 
    treatment = randomize(units_per_group = 20))

```

---

# Size of the Observed Difference

- The p-value.
- How often did I get a randomization under the sharp null where the estimate was larger than my actual estimate?
- For each, is it larger than the average treatment effect estimate?
- This is a sampling distribution.
- How big is my estimate relative to the distribution of estimates?

---

# Size of the Observed Difference 

In this particular case, 

```{r estimate p-value}
experimental_randomization <- randomize(units_per_group = 20)
experimental_ate <- estimate_ate(
  y_values = outcomes, 
  treatment = experimental_randomization)

sharp_null <- replicate(
  n = 5000, 
  expr = estimate_ate(

# P-Values and Hypothesis Tests

---

# P-Values 

- If the treatment had no effect, how likely is it that the data would generate  a difference this extreme, *just by chance*?
- What is the difference between the mean in the control and treatment groups?
- Different from how likely it is the treatment has an effect
- Convention is to reject the null with p-value under 0.05.
- p-values don't tell you for sure that the treatment has an effect.
- They just tell you how likely it is you would have gotten that result by chance.
- The sampling distribution tells us how large the differences are we find by chance.
- Can find p-values < 0.05 even when the null hypothesis is correct.
