# A Few Clarifications
- What does "reduced form" mean?
- We previously talked about regressing treatment $X$ on instrument $Z$, computing the fitted values of $X$, then regressing outcome $Y$ on these fitted values $\hat{X}$
- **Reduced-form equation:** "Reduces" these two equations to a single equation, the regression of $Y$ on $Z$


- The initials in the example's names correspond to:
  - **A**lvaro $\leftrightarrow$   **A**lways-takers
  - **C**amila   $\leftrightarrow$  **C**ompliers
  - **N**ormando $\leftrightarrow$ **N**ever-takers


- The author's Passover analogy is not entirely clear but may be as follows for four types of children:
  - Wise $\leftrightarrow$ Compliers
  - Wicked $\leftrightarrow$ Defiers
  - Simple $\leftrightarrow$  Always-takers
  - Doesn't know how to ask $\leftrightarrow$ Never-takers


- "External validity" is a common term, but I prefer the term "generalizability"

# Example: Vietnam Draft Lottery 
## and Returns to Schooling
----

#### Instrumental variables can be used for natural experiments where the treatment is a continuous variable rather than binary


#### Example: Angrist and Krueger (1992) 
- Used the Vietnam draft lottery as a natural experiment to assess returns to schooling on earnings
- During the Vietnam War, a fraction of young men from every birth year were prioritized for draft via a lottery system based on birth date
- Men with lower draft numbers became more likely to enroll in college because an education deferment would allow them to avoid service
- Thus, the lottery created a random variation in the number of years of schooling, which created an opportunity to estimate returns to schooling


---
# Example: Vietnam Draft Lottery 


- We start the IV regression with a person's years of schooling $X$ regressed on instrument $Z$, the order his birth date was pulled in the lottery
  - Then we regress earnings $Y$ on the predicted values of years of schooling $X$
  - This tells us how the "clean" variation in number of years of schooling affects earnings
- This IV regression is much better than simply regressing wages on years of schooling, which is fraught with OVB problems


---
# Example: Vietnam Draft Lottery
###Potential Problem: Violation of the Exclusion Restriction
----

- The required assumption is that the random process cannot affect the outcome in any way other than the treatment being examined
  - This assumption is no problem in many examples such as the KIPP lottery
- However, serving in Vietnam may affect earnings in ways unrelated to schooling
  - Eg. PTSD may reduce earnings, which would underestimate returns to schooling
- In the next example, David Broockman will describe a natural experiment where the exclusion restriction might be violated

# Optional Example:
## .center[Does Economic Stagnation Cause War?]


---
# Does Economic Stagnation Cause War?
- Can foreign aid prevent civil war?
- Need randomly assigned economic growth
  - Rain tends to be associated with economic growth in agricultural areas

### Rain $\rightarrow$ Economic Growth $\rightarrow$ Less Civil War?

- Compare countries with high rainfall to low
- "If there's a correlation between rain and civil war, it could only be caused by lower economic growth"
- Potential policy recommendation: If war looks likely, send money
- But is economic growth the only way rain could affect civil war?
  - "No one likes to fight a war when it's muddy"

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Natural Experiments


---
# Advantages of Natural Experiments

1. If you are lucky enough to find one, you save the time of running the experiment
2. Estimation is straightforward
  - IV/2SLS is very similar to OLS
  - Estimation packages like "ivreg" in R give correct standard errors
  
  
---
#Disadvantages of Natural Experiments

1. Administration of randomizing can be difficult
  - People select, randomization fails, etc.
  - In an observational natural experiment, you have no control over the design, data collection, execution, block, or attrition
2. You might not find a natural experiment on the topic you care about
  - Good natural experiments can be as rare as unicorns
  - We often have to run the experiments ourselves

# Introduction to Regression Discontinuity


---
# Regression Discontinuity 
## Figure 4.2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='50%', out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/figure4_4a.png')
```

- There is a non-random "running variable": age
- There is a "threshold": the minimum legal drinking age of 21


---
# Regression Discontinuity 
## Figure 4.2

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='50%', out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/figure4_4b.png')
```

- It seems reasonable to believe that other reasons for mortality are exactly the same for someone who is 20 years, 364 days old, and someone who is exactly 21 years old
  - If we compare people on either side of the discontinuity, the difference should be due only to the access of alcohol
  
  
---
# Regression Discontinuity
## Equation 4.2

$$\bar{M}_{a} = \alpha + \rho D_{a} + \gamma a + e_{a}$$

- We regress the outcome (mortality rate) on:
 - A treatment dummy variable (are you over 21?)
 - A linear term for age, in years. This allows for a time trend in mortality

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='50%', out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/figure4_4c.png')
```
- Figure 4.2 shows the resulting regression line: downward-sloping, except for a discrete jump on the 21st birthday

---
# Regression Discontinuity
## Equation 4.2 

- For a "fancy" analysis, we can: 
  - Use a quadratic regression (rather than linear) **OR**
  - Allow the regression to change slope right at the discontinuity
- But these are niceties
- We care most about the discrete jump in $Y$ at the age discontinuity


---
# Reading Assignment

- See if you can recognize the placebo tests

# Equation 4.4

$$\overline{M}_{a} = \alpha + \rho D_{a} + \gamma_{1}(a-a_{0}) + \gamma_{2}(a-a_{0})^{2}+\delta_{1}[(a-a_{0})D_{a}]+\delta_{2}[(a-a_{0})^{2} D_{a}] + e_{a}$$
- This "fancy" regression allows the relationship between mortality and age to have: 
  - A quadratic shape to the left of the 21st birthday
  - A different quadratic shape to the right

```
- The solid curved line shows the fancy (quadratic) regression curve
- The dashed straight line shows the simple regression curve
  - The slope on the simple curve must be the same on either side of the discontinuity
  - The fancy curve has a different slope and curvature on each side

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='50%', out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/figure4_4c.png')
```
- The solid curved line shows the fancy (quadratic) regression curve
- The dashed straight line shows the simple regression curve
  - The slope on the simple curve must be the same on either side of the discontinuity
  - The fancy curve has a different slope and curvature on each side
  - This particularly captures the jump in mortality rates right after the 21st birthday
  - The curve declines over time, but the mortality rate at age 23 is still a little higher than at 20


---
# Equation 4.4 Results - Figure 4.4 

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='50%', out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/figure4_4.png')
```

- We don't want to extrapolate too far--the power of an RD is right at the break point
- Since the trends are gradual, some extrapolation may be okay
  - Legal access to alcohol appears to produce higher mortality rates, especially at first
  - Continuing for a couple of years, mortality rates return to baseline

# Placebo Tests: Figure 4.5
### Table 4.1 and Figure 4.5 show placebo tests
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='50%', out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}

```


---
# Placebo Tests: Figure 4.5
### Table 4.1 and Figure 4.5 show placebo tests
  
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='50%', out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/figure4_5a.png')
```
- Deaths from disease ("internal causes") show no serious jumps at the discontinuity


---
# Placebo Tests: Figure 4.5
### Table 4.1 and Figure 4.5 show placebo tests
```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='50%', out.width='90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/figure4_5b.png')
```
- Deaths from disease ("internal causes") show no serious jumps at the discontinuity
- Motor vehicle fatalities show a substantial jump
- This makes us even more confident that the jump we saw in the initial RD is really a causal effect of legal access to alcohol
  - Deaths associated with alcohol show a big jump
  - Deaths associated with other causes don't move
  
  
---
# Parametric vs. Nonparametric RD

- **Parametric RD:** We estimate regression lines or curves and have a shift due to the treatment dummy variable
- **Nonparametric RD:** we avoid assuming some parametric form, in case that might introduce specification error
  - Instead, we look at the simple change in $Y$ in a narrow window around the threshold
- **Bandwidth** is the width of this window


---
# Parametric vs. Nonparametric RD
## Table 4.1

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height='25%', out.width='50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/table4_1.png')
```

- In Table 4.1, the results are not very sensitive to the choice of window
- We see similar estimates when we compare Column 1 (window ages 19-22) to Column 3 (window ages 20-21)

---
# Parametric vs. Nonparametric RD

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/table4_1_short.png')
```

---
# Parametric vs. Nonparametric RD
## Table 4.1 (cont'd)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='40%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/Table4_1.png')
```

- Trade-off of narrow bandwidth:
  - Gives a much cleaner RD. We think all other things are equal on both sides of the threshold **BUT**
  - Cuts down on amount of data, which decreases precision. Notice how Column 3 has larger standard errors than Column 1


---
# Policy Question
- Chapter 4 opened with the policy question **What should the drinking age be?**
- With RD, we saw that legal access to alcohol has a big causal effect on mortality for 21-year-olds
- Does that tell us what would happen if we reduced the drinking age to 18?
  - Maybe, but we have to think about generalizability
- Earlier we discussed "local average treatment effects". With RD we get a very local ATE
  - We have learned the effects of alcohol access on mortality for 21-year-olds
  - We cannot be certain these results would generalize to 18-year-olds
- Next, David Broockman will discuss a few more examples of RD

# Common Issues With
##Regression Discontinuity Designs
----

### "Sorting" at cut point

####Ex ante: before the event
- People are aware of the threshold and can try to get above it
- Eg. Latin honors
  - Effect of honors on success in labor market
  - Awareness of threshold results in better students just above cutoff
  
#### Ex post: after the event
- Eg. Elections of Black mayors in the 1970s
- Black candidates disproportionately lost by slim margins
- Manipulations make analysis difficult

---
# Tests for Sorting
#### **Covariate balance** on either side of cut point
- Does covariate balance hold up based on early measurements?


####**Smoothness (McCrary test)**
- Eg. effects of minimum-wage laws on unemployment
- Comparison between states based on margin of vote passing

  - Does covariate balance hold up based on early measurements?

#### **Smoothness (McCrary test)**
- Eg. effects of minimum-wage laws on unemployment
- Comparison between states based on margin of vote passing
- Can't directly compare bills due to differences in kinds of bills that just pass and just fail
- Check for proportion of observations in running variable
  - Eg. fraction of yes votes vs treatment variable
- Passage of regression discontinuity check doesn't guarantee assumptions hold
- Check for lack of covariate balance, lack of smoothness

# Difference in Differences


---
# Reading Assignment
#### The third observational technique we will consider is called **difference in differences (DiD)**
- This technique is used when a natural experiment takes place over time, in a before-after setting, and when we don't have a randomized control group
- Instead, we have a group that is similar to the treated group but not guaranteed to be identical

### Read *Mastering Metrics*, Section 5.1, page 178 through the top of page 187

# Difference in Differences
## Effects of Federal Reserve Lending Policy to Mississippi Banks
----
- It is difficult to do a field experiment on monitary policy
- Instead we look for a natural experiment
  - In 1930, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta (6th District) chose to provide much more credit to troubled banks than did the St. Lous Fed (8th District)
  - The state of Mississippi was divided almost equally between the two districts

---
# Difference in Differences
## Effects of Federal Reserve Lending Policy to Mississippi Banks
----

- The banks are not randomized, so a simple difference can be misleading
  - In 1931, 11 fewer banks were open in the 6th District than the 8th
  - We might be tempted to conclude that easy lending caused more banks to close
  - BUT before the crisis, 30 fewer banks were open in the 6th District
- We must account for this baseline difference
- This is what DiD does by subtracting the before-after difference in the treatment group from the before-after difference in the psuedo-control group


---
# Figure 5.3: DiD Strategy Illustration
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}

```
- To get a valid causal difference with DiD, we need to satisfy the **"common trends"** (or "parallel trends" assumption



---
# Figure 5.3: DiD Strategy Illustration
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/figure5_3a.png')
```
- Figure 5.3 shows that this assumption is reasonable
- The hypothesized policy difference occurs in 1930

# Figure 5.3: DiD Strategy Illustration
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}

---
# Figure 5.3: DiD Strategy Illustration
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(path='./figures/figure5_3c.png')

# Figure 5.3: DiD Strategy Illustration
```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}

# DiD Regressions

$Y_{dt}=167-29TREAT_d-49POST_t +20.5(TREAT_d *POST_t)+e_{dt}$
- If we have more than two time periods or more than two comparison groups available, we can implement DiD via a regression

- **TREAT** is a dummy variable equal to one in the treatment group (the 6th district in this example
  - The coefficient of -29 means that in the pretreatment baseline period there were 29 fewer banks open in the 6th District than in the 8th


---
# DiD Regressions

$Y_{dt}=167-29TREAT_d-49POST_t +20.5(TREAT_d *POST_t)+e_{dt}$

- **POST** is a dummy variable
  - POST = 0 prior to treatment
  - POST = 1 during the treatment time period
  - The coefficient of -49 means there was a downward trend in banks open before and after 1930 (49 fewer banks on average during the post-period than in the pre-period in the 8th District)


---
# DiD Regressions

$Y_{dt}=167-29TREAT_d-49POST_t +20.5(TREAT_d *POST_t)+e_{dt}$

- The coefficient of 20.5 on the interaction term is the estimated causal effect of easy lending policy to troubled banks
  - Eg. the difference in the post-period vs the pre-period in the treatment group, relative to the difference in the comparison group
- Next, David Broockman will share some additional examples of DiD

- People with homes were:
  - More upset over housing crisis
  - More likely to get newspapers
  - More likely to receive treatment and vote based on housing crisis
- Ladd and Lenz checked on this using a placebo test
  - DiD when treatment didn't change, readers of other papers
  - No effect seen among readers of other papers, only papers which switched their endorsement

- Rhode Island (RI) banned advertising prices of alcohol
  - Will firms offer less competetive pricing as a result?
- Could compare RI alcohol prices to those in Connecticut and Massachusetts (MA)
  - Other conditions between states might differ
- RI ended advertising ban
  - Can't simply do a before/after analysis
  - Price change could reflect other factors
- Compare changes in RI over time to changes in MA over time
  - Prices increased 2% in Rhode Island
  - Likely due to inflation
- Milyo and Waldfogel (1999) collected data on liquor prices in RI and MA before and after ban
  - Had foresight to collect data when Supreme Court agreed to hear case on advertising ban
  - Found prices of newly advertised products in RI **decreased** relative to same goods in MA
  - Prices didn't drop for product that were never advertised
  - Prices dropped only for newly advertised products

## .center[Home Prices and Incinerator Location]

---
# DiD Example: Home Prices

#### How much do property values drop as a result of having an incinerator nearby?
- Can't simply look at home prices in relation to distance from incinerator
  - Why some places have incinerators while others don't?
  - Ideal experiment: randomly assign location of incinerators
  - Incinerators tend to be built in bad neighborhoods where property values are lower to begin with
  - Unobserved heterogeneity (Eg. bad construction or recently built development)


---
# Kiel and McClain (1995)
- DiD approach
- Collected data in two time periods:
  - Before incinerator announced
  - After incinerator built
- Compared data in North Andover to other locations
- Found home prices near incinerator increase about 5% less but not significantly significant
  - Other characteristics matter more
  - Extra bathroom: +13% +/- 5%
  - Average prices over time (before/after): +14% +/- 6%

---
# DiD Example: Home Prices
#### Importance of the DiD Approach

- Home prices near incinerator could have had lower baseline resulting from pre-existing differences
- **DiD protects from false conclusions drawn from simple before/after approach**
- Vulnerabilities still exist
  - Eg. demographic changes could lead to incinertor being built in the first place



---

# Strengths and Weaknesses of DiD


---
# Strengths of DiD
- DiD is a simple tool: we computer differences directly or do OLS regression with clustered standard errors
- If we have covariates that might predict differences in $Y$, we can include them to try to improve precision
- Causal effects are much stronger and more believable than with simple before/after differences or simple differences across non-randomized comparison groups


---
# Weaknesses of DiD
- Causal inference hinges on the assignment mechanism
- The common trends (parallel trends) assumption is a strong assumption.
- An example where it fails: observational online-advertising
  - People may be gone on vacation
  - People may see simultaneous newspaper advertising campaigns
