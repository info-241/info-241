# Spillovers

---
# What are spillovers?

Effects of one person's treatment on the outcome of another person
- Regardless of whether the second person was treated
- Eg. Person A in ad campain treatment discusses the ad with person B in the control group
- When this interaction causes B to make a purchase she would not have made otherwise, this is **spillover**

# Reading Assignment

## Read *Field Experiments*, Chapter 8
- Note for discussion any jargon you don't understand
- Make sure you understand the bulleted list of examples on pages 255 and 266

# Example: Job-Performance Monitoring 


---
# Example: Nagin et al (2002)

## Research Question: Are employees padding their results to qualify for bonuses? 
- Measuring effects of increased monitoring on quality of job performance 
  - Telemarketing firm solicits donations for charity
  - Employee earn bonus for each successful pledge
  - Some reported pledges never materialize

## Approach
- Spot-check a fraction of each employee's reported donors
- "Bad calls" are removed from the employee's bonus
- Some of these may be employee bad luck (eg. donor changed mind), but some may be deliberate cheating
- Minimize expensive spot-checks (callbacks)


---
# Example: Nagin et al (2002) cont'd 

## Experiment
- How does the audit probability effect employee performance?
  - Pre-experiment callback rate: 10%
  - Experimental rates reported back to employees: 0%, 2%, 5%, and 10%
  - Actual experimental rate: 25%
  - An employee in the 10% group would have 25/100 calls audited, but only 10 of those used to report back to employee
  
  
---
# Results
- When zero audited calls are reported back to an employee, the fraction of bad calls inreases by 3%
  - Baseline mean: 2%
  - Minimum rate to affect performance: 2%
  - No statistically significant difference between 2%, 5%, and 10%


---
# The Spillover Effect
Employees may compare notes
- People in 0% treatment group may realized peers audited at 5%
- May expect increased monitoring in the future
  -professor's correction: audit probability is about to 5%, not above 5%

Without spillover effect:
- Treatment effect should show what would happen if company switched policy from 0% to 5% on every employee

With spillover effect:
- 5% treatment should create spillover effect
- 0% group should expect more auditing and make fewer bad calls

# Example Continued: Spillovers and Experimental Design


---
# Quiz Answer

**Question:** With spillovers, would we expect a simple randomized experiment to underestimate or overestimate the effect of changing the auditing policy?

**Answer: ** Underestimate
- Word-of-mounth effect makes 0% and 5% groups more similar and reduces estimated treatment effects


---
# What can we do to improve design?

Randomize at work-site level (eg. different cities) instead of individual level
- Distance between groups of employees minimizes chance of spillover
- Represents clustered design (see *Field Experiments* 3.6.2)


---
# Clustered Design
Used in telemarketing example (Nagin et al 2002) to avoid spillover problems
- 16 sites
- 12 in control group (5% audit rate)
- Four treatment sites: 0%, 2%, 5%, and 10% rates reported
  - Data collected at 25%
- Cross-site variation in treatment provides basis for results
- Within-site variation obtained by reshuffling treatments after six weeks
  - Addresses concerns about everyone in a given treatment gropu having correlated behavior for reasons other than the treatment


---
# Advantages and Disadvantages

## Clustered Design Advantages:
- Reduced word-of-mounth spillovers
- Easier administration

## Clustered Design Disadvantages:
- Less randomization
- Less precision in estimated treatment effect
  - Due to possible correlation of outcomes within treatment
  - Eg. perhaps rain is correlated with certain employee or donor behaviors
  - Clustered standard errors correctly estimate this uncertainty; regular standard errors are underestimated

#Reading Assignment

## Read *Field Experiments*, Section 8.1

Make sure you understand the roommate example, specifically:
- How ignoring spillover (externality) affects bias
- New subscript notation on potential outcomes
  - First subcript is roommate
  - Second subscript is treated individual (self)

# Identifying Causal Effects in the Presense of Spillovers

---
# Example in 8.1

## Assumptions

From pg 257, first paragraph, last sentence

- No spillovers will come from outside household
- Majority of spillovers will come from roommates
- Outside (non-roommate) spillovers complicate modeling too much to handle
  -Assume they are small enough to ignore
  
  
---
# Example in 8.1

## Political mailings and word of mouth

- Consider direction of bias if we ignore spillover and study individual randomization
- Underestimate true effect on voter turnout
- Word-of-mouth constitutes indirect treatment
  - Treatment group member happens to talk about political content with someone in the control group
  - Reduces treatment effect


---
# Reading Assignment

## *Fields Experiments* Section 8.2

Goal is to understand:
- How spillover can bias main treatment effect
- How to use clustered designs to correct bias

Focus primarily on *pgs 260-261*
- Kinds of proximity that might cause spillovers
- Last sentence of page 261: **We are ignoring spillovers from a distance of two or more units**
- Compute probabilities in Table 8.3 by understanding the relationship to Figure 8.1
- Don't worry about pages 262-263 (location-adjacent version of probability-weighting problem in Section 4.5)

---
# Making Assumptions

Arbitrary assumptions about geographic extent of spillover can radically change estimates
- Eg. what if spillover range is 750 m vs 500 m?
- What if not constant?
  - Linear decline
  - Quadradic decline

Contrast with usual virtue of experiments: make measurements with minimal assumptions

Assumption problems not unique to geography
- Eg. social networks

# Findings
- Treatment point estimates uniformly positive every week
- Difference-in-difference assumption may have caused overestimation
  - All obsvations based on same pre-period
  - Overestimation due to pre-period differences will carry over to all subseguent weeks
- Results show evidence of long-term effects of advertising

# Within-Subjects Design and Time-Series Experiments


---
# Within-Subjects Design: Why?
- Variance in *y* always reduces precision of estimated treatment effects
  - Social sciences involve much heterogeneity between subjects
  - Using a person as a control for himself reduces variance
    - Ultimate paired-subjects design
- Some real-life questions concern just one person
  

---
# Single-Subject Examples

- Will I feel better if I eat fewer carbs?
- Will I want to keep exercising if I can do it for 30 days?
- How do I know whether avoiding gluten will help me?
- These questions require self-experimentation (within-subject, over time)
- Caution: Statistical inference difficult without multiple repetitions of treatment and control

---
# Within-Subjects Design: Why Not?

Benefits of randomization lost
- Independence from other factors that might cause outcome
  - Before-after experiment on advertising: How do we know the "after" week didn't happen to take place at a time when the subject was more likely to shop anyway?
  - Impossible to predict in advance what other events might influence the outcome
- Impossible to predict in advance what other events might influence outcome
  
Ample permutation space for statistical inference
- Best attainable *p*-value is 0.5
  
Including many time periods can solve this problem
- Room for randomization
- Enough data for valid standard-error estimates

- Roll out treatment to control group in stages
- Also known as *Stepped-wedge* designs

---
# Benefits of Waitlist Design

- Allows experimentation
- Allays concerns about witholding treatment
- Can delay widespread treatment long enough to see effects in early treatment groups before administering to all groups
- Long-run *and* simultaneous treatment effects

# What to Remember From This Week

All experiments aim for *Ceteris paribus* "all other things being equal" except treatment effect

Spillovers between subjects can bias results:
- Positive spillovers: underestimation (eg. I see ads and take my friend to the store)
- Negative spillovers: overestimation (eg. extra police divert crime to a difference area)

Clustered treatment can eliminate this bias

Within-subjects design can be valuable if treatment effects are limited in time

Stepped-wedge designs get variation both within and between subjects
