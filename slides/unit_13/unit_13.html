# Oversampling a Subpopulation

---
# Introduction
#### **Example:** MN Dept of Revenue tax-compliance experiment
- Anticipated heterogeneous treatment effects
  - People with high income have more incentive to hide income
  - People with more opportunity to hide income (self-employed) more likely to under-report
- Without oversampling, treatment group of 1,500 taxpayers contained *only 7* high-income, high-opportunity earners
  - This is the population we are most interested in
  - Oversampling increased this to 80 people

---
# When to Oversample

#### When we have a particularly interesting subpopulation
- Some examples:
  - High-opportunity taxpayers
  - Girls in computer-programming course
  - Minority legislators in study about response to minority constituents

#### When important subpopulation represents a small fraction of overall population

#### When important subpopulation has relatively high variance of `\(Y\)`
- Standard deviation is many times the mean
- Large samples can overcome huge variance

---
# Adaptive Sampling

#### **Adaptive Sampling:** Adjust experiment based on responses
- For example:
  - If an A/B test reveals one sub-population has high variance of purchases, then
  - Oversample this high-variance group

---
# Summary

### If a group is either **very small** or has **high variance**, oversampling is prudent

---
# Reading 

## Please Read: *Field Experiments* Section 12.3
- This section will cover a catalogue mailing experiment that was conducted by Simester et al. (2009) 
- Pay particular attention to how the authors choose to measure their outcome

# How Broadly Should We Define the Outcome?

---
# Simester, *et al.* (2009) Experiment

#### Catalog mailing experiment showing how long-run effects differ from short-run effects
- Sending extra 5 catalogs in 8-month experiment produced positive return on investment
- Measured effect smaller with more broadly-defined outcome
  - Majority of effect from accelerating purchases forward in time
  - Negative treatment effect on purchases for 8 months following experiment
  - Negative treatment effect for website purchases for same retailer

---
# Comparison 1
## Lewis and Reiley Advertising Experiment
----
#### Outcome defined more broadly
- Online ads had positive treatment effect on online sales, as well as brick-and-mortar stores
- Study included examination of purchases for 10 weeks after conclusion of 2-week ad campaign
  - No evidence of acceleration of purchases
  
#### Lesson: pay attention to outcomes of actual concern (in this case total sales)

---
# Comparison 2
## Employee Reciprocity Study: Labor Economics
----
#### Lab experiments with two people in job market scenario
- Employer, employee
- Employer: decides how much to pay employee
- Employee: decides how hard to work for employer
  - Effort level: 0 - 10
  - Cash payout to employee subtracts effort from what employer paid


#### Game theory predictions:
  - Employee has received wage; no incentive to engage in costly effort
  - Employer has no incentive to pay more than minimum wage

---
# Comparison 2
## Employee Reciprocity Study: Labor Economics
----
#### Actual results:
  - Most employers set wages well above minimum
  - Employees who receive higher wage offers tend to work harder for employer than employees who receive low wage offers
- We know this is treatment effect of offer received
- Evidence of reciprocity effect between workers and wage-setting employees

---
# Comparison 3
## Gneezy and List (2006) field experiment
----
- Wanted to see what would happen when people are being paid actual money for actual work, rather than in a laboratory setting
- Students hired to solicit charitable donations
- Half received higher-than-advertised wage
- In first hour, higher-paid students brought in more donations (positive reciprocity treatment effect)
- A few hours (or days) later, treatment effect diminished

#### Lesson: We may need to redefine the outcome to be more broad
- Redefining outcome more broadly here lead to different conclusion

---
# Conclusion

### Long-run effects are difficult to measure in laboratory experiments

&lt;br&gt;

### Treatment effects may wear off after longer period of time

# Reading Assignment
## Please Read: *Field Experiments*, Section 12.4  
- Bertrand &amp; Mullainathan Audit Study
- **Audit Study:** Field experiment where research doesn't necessarily follow through with a completed transaction

# Audit Studies

---
# Recap:
## Bertrand and Mullhainathan job discrimination study
----
- Drew from identical resumes with white-sounding names vs. black-sounding names
- Showed clear evidence of discrimination against black-sounding candidate names
- Proves causal effect of race

#### This is an audit study because we didn't perform the call-back interviews based on responses from employers

---
# Bertrand and Mullainathan Audit Study:
## Advantages
----

- Drawing from variety of names and variety of high/low quality resumes `\(\rightarrow\)` more generalizable treatment effect
- Sending four resumes (black-sounding, white-sounding, high- and low- quality) per firm to identify some within-employer effects
  - Which candidates were called back?
  - What did distribution of discrimination look like?
- Is double-blind 
  - If we had done face-to-face interviews it would have required actors to go to interviews, could no longer be double blind
  
---
# Aside: Car Dealer Audit Study
### Scenario: black and white consumers visited car dealers

- Followed script to counter with lower price than price offered by dealer
- Result: Black consumers ended up with a higher negotiated price
- Problems:
  - Actors behaved differently from one another
  - Actors were small in number
  - Treatment effect could erroneously be ascribed if one white actor had exceptional negotiating skills

# Bertrand and Mullainathan Audit Study:
## Advantages
----
- Drawing from variety of names and variety of high/low quality resumes `\(\rightarrow\)` more generalizable treatment effect
- Sending four resumes (black-sounding, white-sounding, high- and low- quality) per firm to identify some within-employer effects
  - Which candidates were called back?
  - What did distribution of discrimination look like?
- Is double-blind 
  - If we had done face-to-face interviews it would have required actors to go to interviews, could no longer be double blind
- Used wide variety of resumes (inexpensive way to expand the study)
- Used factorial design
  - 2x2 design (two races, two quality levels)
  - More discrimination for high-quality or low-quality resumes?

# Next: Schneider (2012)Audit Study
### Does expectation of repeat business cause an auto mechanic to behave differently?

---

class: inverse, middle, center
# Example: 
## .center[Schneider (2012) Audit Study]

---

# Schneider (2012) Audit Study
## Overview
----
- Investigated effect of expected repeat business on behavior of auto mechanics
- Hypothesis: a firm is likely to work harder when expecting repeat business or referrals
  - Doing high-quality work for you is important because of the expectation of generation of new business
- Schneider broke his own car in ways that should be repaired for safety during a road trip, then visited mechanics for inspection and estimated cost of repairs
  - Loose battery cable, low coolant, missing tail light, etc.
  
---
# Schneider (2012) Audit Study
## Details
----
- Went to 40 repair shops and assigned each to one of two treatments:
  - Low reputation: "I'm moving from New Haven to Chicago in two weeks."
  - High reputation: "I'm taking a vacation to Montreal in two weeks."
- Destinations are similar distances from origination city
- Only difference in treatment is the expectation that he will vs. will not be living in New Haven in the future
- Requested estimate for repairs
- Never intended to purchase repairs, which is what makes this an audit study


---
# Schneider (2012) Audit Study
## Results
----

- Charged more than twice as much for estimate in low-reputation treatment vs. high-reputation treatment
- No significant difference in diagnosing problems between treatments

# Example:
## .center[Bandiera *et al.* Personnel Economics]

---

# Example: Bandiera *et al.* Experiment
## Overview
----
#### Personnel Economics: Study of employee behavior
- British farm employed Eastern Europeans to pick fruit in Summer 2005
- Initial employee wages tied to *relative* performance
  - Farm wanted to implement productivity incentives
  - Farm manager reluctant to set piece rate (pay per unit picked) because picking conditions vary considerably
  - Payments relative to quantities picked by others
- Researchers wanted to try *absolute* performance payments
  - Fixed amount per piece picked
  - Implementation half-way through Summer
  - Deliberate intervention designed to measure causal effects
  - Before/After design constraint related to concern regarding spill-over effects from employees talking to one another

---

# Example: Bandiera *et al.* Experiment
## Results
----
- Productivity increased substantially from first to second half of summer
- Productivity per worker increased under *absolute* vs *relative* payment
- Variance of output per worker much higher

#### Proposed explanation:
- High-ability workers were holding back under *relative* payment
  - Lived and socialized almost exclusively with co-workers
  - Had fear of co-workers opinions
  - Worried that out-picking others lowered compensation for all
  
#### Evidence that relative performance scheme can encourage people to work less

---

# Example: Bandiera *et al.* Experiment
## Evaluation
----
#### Study was not randomized

#### Study included three comparisons:
- Late part of Summer vs. early part: Sharp increase in productivity
- That year vs. previous year (same time frame): *Absolute* payment outperformed *relative*, had higher variance
- Pickers of strawberries vs. raspberries
  - Raspberries on tall bushes with briers limited visibility
  - Above results held for pickers of strawberries but not raspberries
  - Raspberries functioned as control

# Example:
## .center[Response to Incentives]

---

# Charness and Gneezy (2009)
## Overview
----
#### Are people more likely to excercise if they are paid to go to the gym?
- Charness and Gneezy (2009) worked with UCSD student gymnasium
- Introduced three conditions:
  - Control
  - Low: $25 for one visit in a week
  - High: $100 for 8 additional visits in next 4 weeks
- Collected data on gym attendance for 7 weeks post-experiment
- Collected data on gym attendance pre-experiment

---

# Charness and Gneezy (2009)
## Results
----
- People in high-incentive condition developed exercise habit that extended beyond experiment
- Heterogeneous treatment effect
  - Highest effect in participants who did not previously exercise at gym at all
  - Low effect in participants who were already going to gym
  
---

# Charness and Gneezy (2009)
## Limitations
----
- Examination of carry-over effect to subsequent semesters was not possible due to inaccessibility of data
- Attempt to replicate similar results for the long-term didn't work
  - Places limit on generalizability regarding habit formation

---

# Additional Incentive Examples

## "Can we pay people to..."

- Lose weight?
- Quit smoking?
- Take blood pressure medication consistently?
- Get better grades?
  - Fryer's attempt to pay students to get better scores was ineffective
  
---

# Incentives, Unintended Consequences


#### Gneezy and Rustichini (2000) experiment with Israeli daycare centers
- Imposed fine for late pick-ups
  - Number of late pick-ups increased
- Added 10 additional centers to experiment
  - Six centers had fines imposed for late pick-ups
  - Four centers functioned as controls
- Number of late pick-ups *increased*


#### Behavioral economics explanation
- Prior to fine, parents were loath to impose on daycare workers
  - Fine was interpreted as a price
  - Fine was insufficient to deter unwanted behavior
  
---

# Summary: Experimental Design
#### Strive for originality and creativity
#### Think more broadly
#### Consider ideal experiment to address a research question
#### Draw from other experiments
  - Audit studies
  - Factorial design
  - Double blindness
  - Variety in treatment to create more generalizability
  - Subpopulation oversampling
