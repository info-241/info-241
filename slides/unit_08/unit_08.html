#Introduction

## Noncompliance in randomized experiments

- Sometimes units assigned to treatment do not actually receive treatment 
- This week, we will learn how to deal with noncompliance
  - How to analyze data correctly without inducing bias
  - How to design experiments to improve precision in the presence of noncompliance
- Leading example: Advertising experiments from earlier in the course
  - Randomly assign a person to be targeted with advertising
  - But, they don't browse to the site and so *choose* to receive zero ads
  - Or, some other advertiser non-randomly targets the person so our ad campaign cannot reach them.

# Introduction to Chapter 5

## Get out the vote (GOTV) example

- Treatment assigned at random
  - Canvasser knock on the doors of 1,000 treatment houses
  - Canvassers skip knocking on the doors of 1,000 control houses
  
## In the treatment Group
  - 250 subjects answer the door
  - The other 750 subjects did not receive treatment, *even though they were assigned to*. 
  
## Three groups of individuals 

With three groups of individuals, who should we compare to whom when estimating the treatment effect? 

1. **Group A**: 250 people who answered the doors? 
2. **Group B**: 750 people who didn't answer their doors? 
3. **Group C**: 1,000 people in the control group (on whose doors no one knocked)

# Introduction to Chapter 5 (cont'd) 

## *Field Experiments* considers three options: 

1. Compare group *A* to *C*: treatment individuals vs. control individuals 
2. Compare group *A* to groups *B* and *C* :treated individuals vs. untreated individuals 
3. Compare group *A* and *B* to group *C*: whol treatment group to whole control group

# Example: Yahoo! Ad-Effectiveness 

---

# Yahoo! Ad Experiemnt 

## Group A 
- Assigned to treatment and received treatment 
- 64% of the treatment group 
- Purchased $1.81 per person 

## Group B 
- Assigned to treatment, *but did not receive* treatment 
- 36% of the treatment group 
- Purchased $2.04 per person 

## Group C 
- Assigned to control, *but did not receive* treatment 
- 100% of the control group
- Purchased $1.84 per person 

---

# Yahoo! Ad Experiemnt (cont'd) 

- The correct apples to apples comparison is \{*A* &amp; *B*\} to *C*
- Treatment effect of $$\{(\$1.81 \times 0.64) + (\$2.04 \times 0.36) \} - \$1.84 = \mathbf{\$0.05}$$

## But, what is this effect? 

- Treatment effect is *diluted* but the 36% of consumers in the treatment group who did not receive ads and therefore could not have had any treatment effect
- This $0.04 estimate is called the **intent-to-treat (ITT)** treatment effect 
- The treatment effect on those who were *actually* treated must have been larger than $0.05
- Producing an unbiased estimate of the treatment effect on those actually treated requires *reweighing this ITT*.

# Reading 

## Read *Field Experiments*, Section 5.1
- Section 5.1 introduces new notation about treatment since assignment to treatmetn no longer guarantees that a subject will (or did) receive treatment 
- As before, `\(d = 1\)` indicates that someone received a dose of treatment, and `\(d = 0\)` indicates that someone received a dose of control 
- Section 5.1 introduces new notation, `\(z\)`, that indicates whether someone was assigned ("azzigned" mnemonically) to treatment 

## Assignment and receiving treatment are distinct events 
- Someone might be assigned to treatment, `\(z=1\)`, but choose to take a dose of control, `\(d=0\)`
- In the future, we'll let subjects be assigned to control, `\(z=0\)`, but choose to take a dose of treatment, `\(d=1\)`

# Example: Blood Pressure

# Example: Blood Pressure

## Suppose our goal is to assess the effect of a new blood pressure medicine
  - 100 control individuals are giving nothing, `\(z=0\)`
  - 100 treatment individuals are provided with blood pressure medicine 
    - 60 individuals take their pills, `\(z=1, d=1\)`
    - 40 individuals do not take their pills, `\(z=1, d=0\)`

## Who are the compliers, and who are the never takers?     

---

# Example: Blood Pressure (cont'd) 

- 100 control group units did not take the pill, `\(z=0, d=0\)`, and have a **mean BP = 140**
- 60 compliers who took the pill, `\(z=1, d=1\)`, have a **mean BP = 150**. 
- 40 never-takers who did not take the pill, `\(z=1, d=0\)`, have a **mean BP of 100**

## Don't be tempted! 

- Tempting to na√Øvely conclude that pills increase blood pressure
  - People who take the pill have higher blood pressure than either of the groups that did not take the pill
- But, a more careful analysis would show that the ATE is, in fact, a *reduction* in blood pressure

# Reading: Skip *FE*, Section 5.2

## Key Takeaway #1 

- The **ITT** is the "intent-to-treat" effect 
  - The ITT is the difference of the average outcomes in the group assigned to receive treatment and the group assigned to receive control 
  - The `\(ITT = E[Y|Z=1] - E[Y|Z=0]\)`
  - This is a correct, *apples-to-apples* comparison 
  - But, this estimate will be diluted compared to the actual treatment effect for the people who received the treatment 
  - In other words, the ITT is the treatment effect of the *intention to treat*, `\(z\)`, on the outcome variable `\(Y\)`.

# Reading: Skip *FE*, Section 5.2

## Key Takeaway #2

- The `\(ITT_{D}\)` is the effect of being assigned to treatment, on *receiving a dose of treatment* 
- Because receiving a dose happens **after** random treatment assignment, it meets all the requirements of a causal effect
- `\(ITT_{D} = E[d_{i} | z_{i} = 1] - E[d_{i} | z_{i} = 0]\)` 

## Blood Pressure Example 
- 60% of the treatment group received treatment, `\(E[d_{i} | z_{i} = 1] = 0.6\)`
- 0% of the control group received the treatment, `\(E[d_{i} |z_{i} = 0] = 0.0\)`. 
- And so, `\(ITT_{D} = E[d_{i} | z_{i} = 1] - E[d_{i} | z_{i} = 0] = 0.6 - 0.0 = \mathbf{0.6}\)`

## Alternative Terms 

- *Take up rate* 
- Or, alternative symbol, `\(\alpha\)`

---

# Reading: *FE*, Section 5.3

## Read *Field Experiments*, Section 5.3
- Gerber and Green draw an important distinction between the ATE and the CACE in this section 
  - The ATE is the average treatment effect for the whole population
  - The CACE is the average treatment effect for the population who comply with their assignment 
- When there is non-compliance, we cannot measure the potential outcomes to treatmetn for non-compliers -- none of them receive treatment! 
- Thus, when there is non-compliance, there is no guarantee that the ATE = CACE.
