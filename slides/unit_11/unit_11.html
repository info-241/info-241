# A Few Clarifications
- What does "reduced form" mean?
  - We previously talked about regressing treatment `\(X\)` on instrument `\(Z\)`, computing the fitted values of `\(X\)`, then regressing outcome `\(Y\)` on these fitted values `\(\hat{X}\)`
  - The reduced-form equation **"reduces" these two equations to a single equation**, the regression of `\(Y\)` on `\(Z\)`
- The initials in the example's names correspond to:
.center[ **A**lvaro   &lt;--&gt;   **A**lways-takers]
.center[**C**amila   &lt;--&gt;   **C**ompliers]
.center[**N**ormando &lt;--&gt;   **N**ever-takers]
- The author's Passover analogy is not entirely clear but may be as follows for four types of children:
.center[Wise &lt;--&gt; Compliers]
.center[Wicked &lt;--&gt; Defiers]
.center[Simple &lt;--&gt; Always-takers]
.center[Doesn't know how to ask &lt;--&gt; Never-takers]
- "External validity" is a common term in academic social science, but I prefer the term "generalizability"

# Example: Vietnam Draft Lottery 
## and Returns to Schooling

- IV can be used for natural experiments where the treatment is a continuous variable rather than binary
- Angrist and Krueger (1992) used the Vietnam draft lottery as a natural experiment to assess returns to schooling on earnings
  - During the Vietnam War, a fraction of young men from every birth year were prioritized for draft via a lottery system based on birth date
  - Men with lower draft numbers became more likely to enroll in college because an education deferment would allow them to avoid service
  - Thus, the lottery created a random variation in the number of years of schooling, which created an opportunity to estimate returns to schooling


---
# Example: Vietnam Draft Lottery (cont'd)
- We start the IV regression with a person's years of schooling `\(X\)` regressed on instrument `\(Z\)`, the order his birth date was pulled in the lottery
  - Then we regress earnings `\(Y\)` on the predicted values of years of schooling `\(X\)`
  - This tells us how the "clean" variation in number of years of schooling affects earnings
- This IV regression is much better than simply regressing wages on years of schooling, which is fraught with OVB problems


---
# Potential Problem:
## Violation of the Exclusion Restriction

- The required assumption is that the random process cannot affect the outcome in any way other than the treatment being examined
  - This assumption is no problem in many examples such as the KIPP lottery
- However, serving in Vietnam may affect earnings in ways unrelated to schooling
  - Eg. PTSD may reduce earnings, which would underestimate returns to schooling
- In the next example, David Broockman will describe a natural experiment where the exclusion restriction might be violated

# Optional Example:
## .center[Does Economic Stagnation Cause War?]


---
# Does Economic Stagnation Cause War?
- Can foreign aid prevent civil war?
- Need randomly assigned economic growth
  - Rain tends to be associated with economic growth in agricultural areas

###.center[Rain  -&gt; Economic Growth  -&gt; Less Civil War?]

- Compare countries with high rainfall to low
- "If there's a correlation between rain and civil war, it could only be caused by lower economic growth"
- Potential policy recommendation: If war looks likely, send money
- But is economic growth the only way rain could affect civil war?
  - "No one likes to fight a war when it's muddy"

# Advantages and Disadvantages of Natural Experiments


---
# Advantages of Natural Experiments

- If you are lucky enough to find one, you save the time of running the experiment
- Estimation is straightforward
  - IV/2SLS is very similar to OLS
  - Estimation packages like "ivreg" in R give correct standard errors
  
  
---
#Disadvantages of Natural Experiments

- Administration of randomizing can be difficult
  - People select, randomization fails, etc.
  - In an observational natural experiment, you have no control over the design, data collection, execution, block, or attrition
- You might not find a natural experiment on the topic you care about
  - Good natural experiments can be as rare as unicorns
  - We often have to run the experiments ourselves

# Reading Assignment
### Read *Mastering Metrics*, Section 4.1, pages 147-153
- Measuring the mortality effects of drinking alcohol
- Pay particular attention to figure 4.2: How convincing is this as a demonstration of causal effect?

# Introduction to Regression Discontinuity


---
# Regression Discontinuity 
## Figure 4.2

&lt;img src="./figures/figure4_4a.png" width="90%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- There is a non-random "running variable": age
- There is a "threshold": the minimum legal drinking age of 21


---
# Regression Discontinuity 
## Figure 4.2 (cont'd)

&lt;img src="./figures/figure4_4b.png" width="90%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- It seems reasonable to believe that other reasons for mortality are exactly the same for someone who is 20 years, 364 days old, and someone who is exactly 21 years old
  - If we compare people on either side of the discontinuity, the difference should be due only to the access of alcohol
  
  
---
# Regression Discontinuity
## Equation 4.2
`$$\bar{M}_{a} = \alpha + \rho D_{a} + \gamma a + e_{a}$$`
- We regress the outcome (mortality rate) on"
  - A treatment dummy variable (are you over 21?)
  - A linear term for age, in years. This allows for a time trend in mortality

&lt;img src="./figures/figure4_4c.png" width="70%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Figure 4.2 shows the resulting regression line: downward-sloping, except for a discrete jump on the 21st birthday

---
# Regression Discontinuity
## Equation 4.2 (cont'd)

- For a "fancy" analysis, we can: 
  - Use a quadratic regression (rather than linear) **OR**
  - Allow the regression to change slope right at the discontinuity
- But these are niceties
- We care most about the discrete jump in `\(Y\)` at the age discontinuity


---
# Reading Assignment
### Read *Mastering Metrics* page 153 to end of Section 4.1 on page 164
- See if you can recognize the placebo tests



---

# Example:
## .center[Detailed Analysis of the Effects of the Drinking Age]


---
# Equation 4.4

`$$\bar{M}_a = \alpha + \rho D_a + \gamma_1(a-a_0)^2+\delta_1[(a-a_0)D_a]+\delta_2[(a-a_0)^2]D_a + e_{a}$$`
- This "fancy regression allows the relationship between mortality and age to have: 
  - Ane quadratic shape to the right of the 21st birthday
  - A different quadratic shape to the left
  

---
# Equation 4.4 Results: Figure 4.4

&lt;img src="./figures/figure4_4d.png" width="90%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- The solid curved line shows the fancy (quadratic) regression curve

  
---
# Equation 4.4 Results: Figure 4.4

&lt;img src="./figures/figure4_4e.png" width="90%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- The solid curved line shows the fancy (quadratic) regression curve
- The dashed straight line shows the simple regression curve
  - The slope on the simple curve must be the same on either side of the discontinuity
  - The fancy curve has a different slope and curvature on each side
  - This particularly captures the jump in mortality rates right after the 21st birthday
  - The curve declines over time, but the mortality rate at age 23 is still a little higher than at 20


---
# Equation 4.4 Results: Figure 4.4 (cont'd)
&lt;img src="./figures/figure4_4.png" width="90%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- We don't want to extrapolate too far--the power of an RD is right at the break point
- Since the trends are gradual, some extrapolation may be okay
  - Legal access to alcohol appears to produce higher mortality rates, especially at first
  - Continuing for a couple of years, mortality rates return to baseline
  

---
# Placebo Tests: Figure 4.5
### Table 4.1 and Figure 4.5 show placebo tests
  
&lt;img src="./figures/figure4_5.png" width="90%" height="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
- Deaths from disease ("internal causes") show no serious jumps at the discontinuity
- Motor vehicle fatalities show a substantial jump
- This makes us even more confident that the jump we saw in the initial RD is really a causal effect of legal access to alcohol
  - Deaths associated with alcohol show a big jump
  - Deaths associated with other causes don't move
  
  
---
# Parametric vs. Nonparametric RD

- What we've seen in the earlier figures is **parametric RD**: We estimate regression lines or curves and have a shift due to the treatment dummy variable
- With **nonparametric RD** we avoid assuming some parametric form, in case that might introduce specification error
  - Instead, we look at the simple change in `\(Y\)` in a narrow window around the threshold
- **Bandwidth** is the width of this window


---
# Parametric vs. Nonparametric RD
## Table 4.1

&lt;img src="./figures/table4_1.png" width="50%" height="25%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- In Table 4.1, the results are not very sensitive to the choice of window
- We see similar estimates when we compare Column 1 (window ages 19-22) to Column 3 (window ages 20-21)


---
# Parametric vs. Nonparametric RD
## Table 4.1 (cont'd)

&lt;img src="./figures/Table4_1.png" width="40%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Trade-off of narrow bandwidth:
  - Gives a much cleaner RD. We think all other things are equal on both sides of the threshold **BUT**
  - Cuts down on amount of data, which decreases precision. Notice how Column 3 has larger standard errors than Column 1


---
# Policy Question
- Chapter 4 opened with the policy question **What should the drinking age be?**
- With RD, we saw that legal access to alcohol has a big causal effect on mortality for 21-year-olds
- Does that tell us what would happen if we reduced the drinking age to 18?
  - Maybe, but we have to think about generalizability
- Earlier we discussed "local average treatment effects". With RD we get a very local ATE
  - We have learned the effects of alcohol access on mortality for 21-year-olds, but we cannot be certain these results would generalize to 18-year-olds
- Next, David Broockman will discuss a few more examples of RD

# Example:
## .center[Effects of Unemployment Insurance]


---
# Example of Regression Discontinuity
- Do unemployment benefits lead people to slack off?
- Ideal experiment: randomly assign some countries to strict unemployment regimes
- Find "naturally" occurring coin flip situations
- "Discontinuity" in Austria
  - People over 50 eligible for unemployment benefits
  - People under 50 not eligible
  - Does the age threshold affect worker productivity?
  - Simply comparing young vs. old could lead to false conclusion that being old causes differences in unemployment duration

# Does Getting Elected Make You Rich?

---
# Another Example
- Do people get rich by being elected?
- Ideal experiment: randomly assign person to be elected and measure his/her wealth upon death
- Eggers and Hainmueller
  - Examined wealth at death of British MPs who won or lost by narrow margins
- Interpretation issue: Are results simply due to MPs moving to London?

# Strengths and Weaknesses of Regression Discontinuity Designs


---
# Common Issues With
## .center[Regression Discontinuity Designs]

### "Sorting" at cut point

####Ex ante: before the event
- People are aware of the threshold and can try to get above it
- Eg. Latin honors
  - Effect of honors on success in labor market
  - Awareness of threshold results in better students just above cutoff
  
#### Ex post: after the event
- Eg. Elections of Black mayors in the 1970s
- Black candidates disproportionately lost by slim margins
- Manipulations make analysis difficult


---
# Tests for Sorting
- Covariate balance on either side of cut point
  - Does covariate balance hold up based on early measurements?
- Smoothness (McCrary test)
  - Eg. effects of minimum-wage laws on unemployment
  - Comparison between states based on margin of vote passing
- Can't directly compare bills due to differences in kinds of bills that just pass and just fail
- Check for proportion of observations in running variable
  - Eg. fraction of yes votes vs treatment variable
- Passage of regression discontinuity check doesn't guarantee assumptions hold
- Check for lack of covariate balance, lack of smoothness

# Difference in Differences


---
# Reading Assignment
- The third observational technique we will consider is called **difference in differences (DID)**
- This technique is used when a natural experiment takes place over time, in a before-after setting, and when we don't have a randomized control group
- Instead, we have a group that is similar to the treated group but not guaranteed to be identical
