# Problems and Diagnostics Introduction



---
class: inverse, center, middle 
# Common Implementation Problems


---
# Review from previous weeks
## Compliance Problems
- Incomplete control over treatment delivery
  - Solutions: Intent to treat or placebo design
- Accidental delivery to control group


---
# New Implementation Problems
- Randomization system doesn't work as intended
- Treatment not delivered or not received
  - E.g. letters not read or emails not opened
- Unintended effects of treatment


---
# Hawthorne Effect
## The Effect of change or novelty

#### Social experiment conducted at the Hawthorne factory
- Effects on worker productivity
  - Brightness of lights
  - Temperature in factory
- Every variable **seemed** to affect productivity
  - Effects were only **Temporary**

#### Websites
- Changes to a site cause users to act differently
- User activity often normalizes after adjusting to change
  - E.g. Change in purchase flow might cause **temporary** conversion increase


---
# Demand Effects
## Subjects who are aware of being studied often give different answers
- Subjects may give answers they think the researcher wants to hear
- Treatment can alert subjects to what researchers are looking for
- Example: Wearing a Barack Obama sticker may change how people respond to the question "Who do you plan on voting for?"
- Example: study to determine price for new product
  - Subjects might lie if they feel they can affect the price of the new product
- Researchers strive to conceal the connection between survey and treatment


---
# Blind Trials
**Single-blind Trial**: Subject doesn't know

**Double-blind trial**: Experimenter doesn't know

**Triple-blind trial**: Analyst doesn't know group assignments
  - Eliminates fishing expedition problem
  - Biased analysis may cause study to be halted prematurely


---
# Unexpected Implementation Results
### Abstract concepts may result in missed real-world contexts
- **Example:** Restorative justice meetings
  - Attempt at reconciliation between criminals and victims
  - Criminals didn't show up, further damaging victims
  - Pilot study could have prevented problem
- **Example:** Field workers refuse to randomize or think they are helping
  - Canvassers who knock on every door unintentionally ruin control group
- **Example:** TiVo's effect on people remembering ads
  - People wouldn't accept the free TiVo device, treatment group was smaller than expected
  - Started giving TiVo's to people in control group as well

# Detecting Errors


---
# Detecting Errors: Overview
**Pilot studies**: Discover unanticipated problems

**Placebo Tests**: No effect desired

**Manipulation checks**: Was treatment successfully delivered? 



---
# Pilot Studies
## Always run a pilot study, no excuses!

- Unanticipated reactions
  - **Example:** Fake emails to state legislators
  - Intended to study responses based on geographic origin of messages
  - Spillover between legislators
- Flawed power calculations
  - Likelihood of effects of different sizes
  - Baseline
  - Response rates
  - Variance of *y*
- Training Staff for correct implementation
- Determining if systems really work
- New ideas, potential for improvement

# Placebo Tests



---
# Placebo Tests
#### If experiment/experimentation system works, there should be **no difference** in a variable

- Difference in variable suggests a problem with the system
- **A/A test:** Tests a treatment against itself to detect any difference in outcome
- **Traditional placebo test:** Checks other outcomes that treatment shouldn't affect


---
# A/A Placebo Test

### Example: Website optimizer code
In-house system randomly directed to page A or B when page A loaded
- Control: page A loaded
- Treatment: User redirected to page B
- Measured outcome: purchases on page
- Issues:
  - Load time was longer for treatment group
  - Treatment code didn't run on all web browsers. Some users directed to treatment page, but when it didn't load their purchase assigned to control group
  - Unrealized manipulations, E.g. delay loading web page
  - *Page A consistently bested B despite being identical* 
  - Redirect delay and issues made the treatment perform better, not the content


---
# Placebo Test

- Great tool for questioning observational studies
  - To prove bias, look for differences that shouldn't exist if assumption is right
- **Example:** Krueger (1993)
- Research question: Does using computers cause people to earn more?
- Workers who use computers earn 15-20% more
- Ideal experiment: Computers increase productivity, warranting higher wages
- DiNardo and Pischke saw potential bias
  - Found workers who use pencils, pens, and phones also earn more
  - Workers who use screwdrivers earn less
  - Wages depend on *types of jobs that use these tools*, not the tools themselves


---
# Another Placebo Test Example
#### Gerber and Green Placebo Treatment: blood drive non-compliance
- Can't compare compliers to everyone in control group
- Compliers tend to be systematically different
- Compare entire treatment group to entire control group OR treatment compliers to control compliers


---
# Social Influence Example

### Do people influence their friends?
- Many studies ask for a person's weight and weight of friend
- Social network models find that being fatter causes friends to get fatter (causal claim)
  - Likely **not** causal relationship
- What can be controlled for?
- Repeat same procedure where there cannot be a causal affect
  - Same model finds being tall causes friends to get taller, even though this is impossible
  - Social network models struggle to recover causal effects
  
#### Placebo tests can find differences where, if your procedure works correctly, there should be no difference

# Manipulation Checks and Covariate Balance


---
# Manipulation Checks

- In placebo tests we wanted to find no difference. If we did, there might be an issue with our experiment
- Manipulation checks are the opposite
- If experiment worked, there **should** be differences in this variable
- **Example:** Broockman and Bulter (2014) 
  - Treatment: Send letters from legislators
  - Control group: received no letters
  - Did constituents receive letters? Did they learn their legislator's positions?
  - Asked people if they recalled recently receiving a letter from legislator
  - People in treatment group more likely to report having received letter, understand legislator's position
  - Can't use this information in estimation


---
# Manipulation Checks (Cont'd)
- **Example:** Sending postcards to voters causes 10% increase in understanding candidate's position
  - Can't use information in same way as one-sided non-compliance
  - Sanity check, making sure treatment had expected effect
- Particularly important for proving null effect
  - Otherwise it may be believed that your treatment simply wasn't received
- Returning to Broockman and Butler example
  - If no effect, skeptics may believe letters not opened
  - Information not assigned directly to people, it is assigned to their mailbox. 
  
  
---
# Covariate Balance Checks

- Check for problems in implementation of experiments
- Experiments guarantee balance in observable and unobservable characteristics
- Check balance on observable covariates to ensure random assignment was done correctly 
- Example of balance not holding: users in treatment group are more active internet users
  - Might give impression of not conducting clean random assignment
- Especially important when randomization scheme is complex
  - Blocking, clustering, different probabilities
  - Complex systems between researchers and subjects
- See regression unit for more on this


---
# Example of Failing Covariate Balance

- **Example:** Lewis and Reiley's first dataset
- Strange patterns: negative treatment effect
- Large imbalance on pretreatment sales
  - Control group bought more in preperiod than treatment group
  - Reason: vendor truncated data by number of sales
  - Treatment group sales data lost
- This is an example of a problem that would never be expected, but there are all kinds of small things like this that could go wrong
- Really important to check covariate balance as a sanity check


---
# Summary
###1. Conduct a pilot study
###2. Manipulation check to measure delivery of treatment
###3. Placebo test
###4. Check for covariate balance

# Advocating Experimentation


---
# Advocating Experimentation
### 1. Increase perceived benefits
### 2. Decrease perceived costs


---
# Increase Perceived Benefits
### Stimulate curiosity
- Intellectual interest
- Get people excited

### Vivid examples of current data leading to bad decisions
- Conduct placebo test and show practices failing
- Present potential conclusions experiment could produce and ways this could chance practices
- Tell story of why causal inference from observational data might be wrong
  - E.g. Playing outside improves children's eyesight
  - How did people receive treatment?
  - What's different about those people? What are the reasons?


---
# Increase Perceived Benefits (cont'd)

### "Investment in information for future decisions"
- E.g. Firm worries that holding back advertising for sake of experimenting will cost them money
- Short-term costs pay off in future
- Down payment

### Build rapport
- Personal connections lead to willingness to run experiments

### Do small studies as proofs of concept
- Example: Broockman and Butler (2014)
  - One congressman signing on for small study led to results that garnered interest for larger study
- Helps secure greater cooperation


---
# Decrease Perceived Costs

### Administration, unfairness, giving up potential gains from treatment (e.g. ads)

### Delay for some units
- Randomize order of mailings
- Campaign contributions
  - Spread out donations to allow experimentation
  
### Limited resources
- Example: Charity gives 5,000 bed nets to people in Africa
  - Withholding bed nets seems morally questionable
  - Expanding population creates control group without withholding bed nets
  
### Experimentation as investment in information



---
class: inverse, center, middle 
# The Long View


---
# Building Knowledge Over Time
- Try pilot studies
- System should produce covariate balance
- Parameters should look as expected
  - E.g. 80/20 treatment/control split
  - Example: Internet explorer skewed data
- Understand parameters for power analysis
- When creating a system, studies should be useful

# Pooling Results

- Precision-weighted average:

`$$\frac{1}{SE^2}$$`

- Double the standard error gets `\(1/4\)` the weight
- 1/4 sample size means `\(1/4\)` the information
- If variance is the same, weight by number of subjects
- Standard error used to represent adjustment of overall view of treatment
- Meta-analysis summarizes data
