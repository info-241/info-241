# Blocking

- Hard to know if it was due to chance when there are large differences between treatment and control.
- Need to reduce the size of the differences that can arise by chance.
- Increase statistical power given an experiment with same sample and effect size.
- If some variables are related to the outcome, restrict ourselves to randomizations that keep treatment and control similar.

## Suppose there is no effect. 
## Then, the potential outcomes to control are equal 
## to the potential outcomes to treatment.
