# Three or Four Project Ideas 

In this assignment, you and your team are going to propose three or four experiment ideas. Please propose one idea for each member of the team. After feedback from your instructor, your team will choose one of these three proposed ideas to continue to develop into your final project for this class for the semester. As such, the ideas that you propose should be _interesting_ to you, should be _feasible_ for you, and should __meet the requirements_ of the final project. 

## Where should I get ideas? 

This is a class about experiment design and measurement with humans as a core piece of the data generating process. Your experiment should manipulate a human experience and attempt to measure a change in behavior in response to the manipulation. 

Generating ideas is hard. Especially if you haven't had to think about causal questions before; and, especially if you don't know what might be a good idea. There are several ways that you might go about developing ideas. 

1. **You might sit and have a think.** 
   - What are things that you do in your life that you are _certain_ are important? What makes you so certain they are important, and what would happen if you didn't have those things in your life? 
     - These thoughts might come from your daily, family, spiritual, educational, work, or other aspect of your life. 
     - By way of example, you might believe that making your bed is important, or snoozing an alarm, or a children's bedtime routine, or a meditation is important to your wellbeing. Why are these things important? What would be different if they were to change? 
   - What are things that other people are _certain_ are important? What makes them so certain they are important, and what would happen if these things didn't exist? 
2. **You might read or listen to the scientific news.**
   - What are people researching right now, and what do they suppose these things cause? 
     - You can read in the same places that you researched for your first essay, or you can read from [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IMsGTHmklhvetfJJfEm9dhoFM7bvb-YOkN_6mAM8kFM/edit?usp%3Dsharing#heading=h.t4trmpmc92bg). 
     - You can listen to science, economics, politics, or psychology podcasts.
3. **You might look a policies that are being proposed.**
   - Almost without exception, policies, rules, and laws are implemented with the intention of _causing_ a certain event to occur. Sometimes these policies have a good set of causal evidence to support their implementation; many times, they do not. 

### A few examples of past projects

- Do default values change donation amounts?
- Do "made in China" tags increase sales on Trump Flag
- Do "wear facial covering" signs increase compliance to facial covering guidelines?
- Does the word "natural" increase sales in facebook marketplace?
- Does sleeping alone rather than with a partner lead to better sleep?
- Does drinking decaf coffee make me more tired over the long haul?
- Do daily affirmations in the mirror improve feelings of self-worth?
- How much water would potential hikers plan to take based on various scenarios?
- Do people slow down when passing green-yellow plastic figures holding "slow" signs?


# Deliverable 

## A paper abstract of each idea 

As a team, for each project idea, write the _abstract_ of a paper reporting your experimental results, as though you have already successfully completed the experiment. This is a bit of creative fiction: quite clearly you have not yet conducted the experiment, but forming your project in this way can help to assess whether it is worth pursuing. 

Below is a loose suggestion for how to structure this abstract. You need not follow it _exactly_ but it is quite close to form. 

1. The first sentence, in the form of a question that is italicized, should state the research question under investigation. 
2. The second one or two sentences should provide context for why this question is interesting, including any existing observational or experimental work in the area. 
3. The next sentence should describe what your intervention is, and why you chose it. 
4. Then, _creatively_, but plausibly, describe the results that your experiment "has" generated.
5. Finally, describe the implications for what you have found.

## Example Deliverables 
### Example One 

Here is one example of an abstract of this form, written by Vitor Hadad, David A. Hirshberg, Ruohan Zhan, Stefan Wager, Susan Athey at _Proceedings of the National Academies of Science_ in 2021.

The article is here: https://www.pnas.org/content/118/15/e2014602118 and the abstract reads as the following: 

> Adaptive experimental designs can dramatically improve efficiency in randomized trials. But with adaptively collected data, common estimators based on sample means and inverse propensity-weighted means can be biased or heavy-tailed. This poses statistical challenges, in particular when the experimenter would like to test hypotheses about parameters that were not targeted by the data-collection mechanism. In this paper, we present a class of test statistics that can handle these challenges. Our approach is to adaptively reweight the terms of an augmented inverse propensity-weighting estimator to control the contribution of each term to the estimatorâ€™s variance. This scheme reduces overall variance and yields an asymptotically normal test statistic. We validate the accuracy of the resulting estimates and their CIs in numerical experiments and show that our methods compare favorably to existing alternatives in terms of mean squared error, coverage, and CI size.

### Example Two 

Here is another example of an abstact of this form, published by Nick Obradovich and (the courses' very own) Scott Guenther at _Climactic Change_ in 2016. 

The article is here: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-016-1670-9 and the abstract reads as the following: 

> _How can individuals be convinced to act on climate change?__ It is widely assumed that emphasizing personal responsibility for climate change is effective at increasing pro-climate behavior whereas collectively framing the causes of climate change diffuses responsibility and dampens the incentive for individual action. We observe the opposite result. Here we find, across three experiments, that emphasizing collective responsibility for the causes of climate change increases pro-climate monetary donations by approximately 7 % in environmental group members and by 50 % in the general public. Further, highlighting collective responsibility amplifies intent to reduce future carbon emissions. In contrast, focusing on personal responsibility for climate change does not significantly alter donations to climate change advocacy or the intent for future pro-climate behavior. These effects replicate and persist multiple days after treatment.
