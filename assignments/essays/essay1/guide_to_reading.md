# Guide to Reading 

It can be daunting to read academic, and academic-related papers. But, beacuse academics are incentivised to write complete, whole arguments; the writing in academic papers is often more complete than can be found through other media (e.g. Twitter, blogs, etc.). We'll write this guide as though you're reading papers for _Experiments and Causality_, but you can probably modify your approach for others fields as well. 

The balance that professionals _necessairily_ have to strike is between reading the complete argument, and reading the argument quickly. Tim Slade (a TA for the course in the Summer 2021 term) proposed three levels of reading: 

- A five minute read; 
- An hour-long read; and, 
- A week-long read. 

The idea is this: For parts of a problem landscape that you are already familiar with, many new papers make contributions that you can readily incorporate into what you already know. As someone who works to evaluate government programs around education policy, Tim can see a new study come out, quickly identify the contribution that it makes to what he already knows, and move on. However, this ability comes with practice, and with famialiarity with the topic. 

In the rest of this short primer, we provide you with a quick attempt to guide your reading. 

# A five-minute read

In a five minute read, you have the following goals: 

- What is the single, most-core point that this paper is trying to contribute?
- How do they go about arriving at this point? 
- Who are the "good guys" and who are the "bad guys"? There are often scholars or groups that are in conversation through these papers. 
- Do you agree with the point that the authors are arguing for? 
- How will you use this paper in your own work? 

To satisfy these goals, you're going to have to dramatically cut down on the parts of the paper that you read. For _Experiments and Causality_ this would probably take the following form: 

1. Read the abstract; this should tell you what the authors core point is. 
2. Read _at a high level_ the literature review. You cannot possibly read all of this, but it will provide you the context about the status quo, or the bad guys, or the general situation in the landscape of knowledge. 
3. Read _at a high level_ the tables and charts of the paper. If the authors have done a good enough job, this should communicate nearly their whole argument. 
4. Incorporate this into your own work. How would this change what you do? How does this change how you would do it? 

Although this last point might feel quite self-centered (it is...) relating what you've just read into your own life will help you to form ties that you can recall in the future. These connections will keep this from being a singular, unattached fact. 

# An hour-long read 

In an hour long read, you've decicded that this paper affects your own work enough that you'd like to be able to talk with some precision about it. 

- No longer are you satisfied to undertand the main point that the authors make; you want to know more about that main point. 
  - What is the context for this result? 
  - What are the limitations to the breadth of what we can learn form this result?
-  How, specifically, did the authors generate the result that they did? 
  - What were the experimental methods that they used? 
- How did the authors move from concept to data? 
  - How did they measure the concept they were interseted in? What are the strengths and limitations of this form of measurment? 
- How did the authors move from data to conclusions? 
  - Because all statistics are arguments for the most appropriate way to summarise data, how have the authors chosen to summarise their data? 
  - Why is this a good (or a bad idea)?
  - Are there other possible summaries that the authors' could have chosen? What might we have learned if they had?
